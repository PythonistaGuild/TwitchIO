    """The Scopes class is a helper utility class to help with selecting and formatting scopes for use in Twitch OAuth.

    The Scopes class can be initialised and used a few different ways:

    - Passing a ``list[str]`` of scopes to the constructor which can be in the same format as seen on Twitch. E.g. ``["user:read:email", ...]``.

    - Passing ``Keyword-Arguments`` to the constructor. E.g. ``user_read_email=True``

    - Or Constructing the class without passing anything and giving each required scope a bool when needed.

    - There is also a classmethod :meth:`.all` which selects all scopes for you.



    All scopes on this class are special descriptors.
