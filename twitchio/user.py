        Parameters
        ----------
        moderator: str | int | PartialUser
            The ID, or PartialUser, of a user that has permission to moderate the broadcaster's chat room, or the broadcaster's ID if they're making the update.
            This ID must match the user ID in the user access token.
        token_for: str | PartialUser
            User access token that includes the ``moderator:manage:chat_settings`` scope.
        emote_mode: bool | None
            A Boolean value that determines whether chat messages must contain only emotes.
        follower_mode: bool | None
            A Boolean value that determines whether the broadcaster restricts the chat room to followers only.
        follower_mode_duration: int | None
            The length of time, in minutes, that users must follow the broadcaster before being able to participate in the chat room.
            Set only if follower_mode is True. Possible values are: 0 (no restriction) through 129600 (3 months).
        slow_mode: bool | None
            A Boolean value that determines whether the broadcaster limits how often users in the chat room are allowed to send messages.
            Set to True if the broadcaster applies a wait period between messages; otherwise, False.
        slow_mode_wait_time: int | None
            The amount of time, in seconds, that users must wait between sending messages. Set only if slow_mode is True.
            Possible values are: 3 (3 second delay) through 120 (2 minute delay). The default is 30 seconds.
        subscriber_mode: bool | None
            A Boolean value that determines whether only users that subscribe to the broadcaster's channel may talk in the chat room.
            Set to True if the broadcaster restricts the chat room to subscribers only; otherwise, False.
        unique_chat_mode: bool | None
            A Boolean value that determines whether the broadcaster requires users to post only unique messages in the chat room.
            Set to True if the broadcaster allows only unique messages; otherwise, False.
        non_moderator_chat_delay: bool | None
            A Boolean value that determines whether the broadcaster adds a short delay before chat messages appear in the chat room.
            This gives chat moderators and bots a chance to remove them before viewers can see the message.
            Set to True if the broadcaster applies a delay; otherwise, False.
        non_moderator_chat_delay_duration: Literal[2, 4, 6] | None
            The amount of time, in seconds, that messages are delayed before appearing in chat.
            Set only if non_moderator_chat_delay is True.
            Possible values in seconds: 2 (recommended), 4 and 6.

        Creates a clip from the broadcaster's stream.

        This API captures up to 90 seconds of the broadcaster's stream. The 90 seconds spans the point in the stream from when you called the API.
        For example, if you call the API at the 4:00 minute mark, the API captures from approximately the 3:35 mark to approximately the 4:05 minute mark.
        Twitch tries its best to capture 90 seconds of the stream, but the actual length may be less.
        This may occur if you begin capturing the clip near the beginning or end of the stream.

        By default, Twitch publishes up to the last 30 seconds of the 90 seconds window and provides a default title for the clip.
        To specify the title and the portion of the 90 seconds window that's used for the clip, use the URL in the CreatedClip's ``edit_url`` attribute.
        You can specify a clip that's from 5 seconds to 60 seconds in length. The URL is valid for up to 24 hours or until the clip is published, whichever comes first.

        Creating a clip is an asynchronous process that can take a short amount of time to complete.
        To determine whether the clip was successfully created, call [`fetch_clips`][twitchio.user.PartialUser.fetch_clips] using the clip ID that this request returned.
        If [`fetch_clips`][twitchio.user.PartialUser.fetch_clips] returns the clip, the clip was successfully created. If after 15 seconds [`fetch_clips`][twitchio.user.PartialUser.fetch_clips] hasn't returned the clip, assume it failed.

            Requires a user access token that includes the `clips:edit` scope.

        Parameters
        ----------
        has_delay: bool
            A Boolean value that determines whether the API captures the clip at the moment the viewer requests it or after a delay.
            If False (default), Twitch captures the clip at the moment the viewer requests it (this is the same clip experience as the Twitch UX).
            If True, Twitch adds a delay before capturing the clip (this basically shifts the capture window to the right slightly).

        Updates the broadcaster's AutoMod settings.

        The settings are used to automatically block inappropriate or harassing messages from appearing in the broadcaster's chat room.

        Perform a fetch with :meth:`~fetch_automod_settings` to obtain the :class:`~twitchio.models.moderation.AutomodSettings` object to modify and pass to this method.

        You may set either overall_level or the individual settings like aggression, but not both.

        Setting overall_level applies default values to the individual settings. However, setting overall_level to 4 does not necessarily mean that it applies 4 to all the individual settings.
        Instead, it applies a set of recommended defaults to the rest of the settings. For example, if you set overall_level to 2, Twitch provides some filtering on discrimination and sexual content, but more filtering on hostility (see the first example response).

        If overall_level is currently set and you update swearing to 3, overall_level will be set to null and all settings other than swearing will be set to 0.
        The same is true if individual settings are set and you update overall_level to 3 — all the individual settings are updated to reflect the default level.

        Note that if you set all the individual settings to values that match what overall_level would have set them to, Twitch changes AutoMod to use the default AutoMod level instead of using the individual settings.

        Valid values for all levels are from 0 (no filtering) through 4 (most aggressive filtering).
        These levels affect how aggressively AutoMod holds back messages for moderators to review before they appear in chat or are denied (not shown).
